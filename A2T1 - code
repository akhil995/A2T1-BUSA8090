Question 1 :-
1a) code :- awk '$2 < 1000 { print $1,$2}' expression.tab
1b) code:-  awk -F"\t" 'NR == 1 {print; next} $2~/ase/ {print $1,$2,$3}' annotation.tab
1c) code:-  awk -F"\t" 'NR == 1 {print; next} $3~/(Purine|Pyrimidine) biosynthesis/ {print $0}' annotation.tab

Question 2 :- 

2a)

#below mentioned code should be executed in ubuntu/ aws instance 

$wget https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/world_x-db.zip

$sudo apt-get install unzip

$unzip world_x-db.zip

$sudo mysql

#below mentioned code should be executed in mysql

2b ) The code should be executed in mysql

code :-  

mysql> Select b.name as country, a.percentage, c.name as capital
    -> from countrylanguage a inner join country b on a.countrycode=b.code
    -> inner join city c on b.capital=c.id
    > where a.percentage>50 and Language ="English"; 




Question 3: The following command should be executed in r-studio

database link:- https://github.com/akhil995/A2T1-BUSA8090/blob/master/whocovid19deathdata2020.csv

code:- 

#loading librares before performing operations 
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

#plotting the data 

ggplot(data = death_data, aes(reorder(country,deaths), deaths, fill=as.factor(deaths)))+
  geom_col()+
  theme(panel.background = element_blank())+
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(colour = "light blue"))+
  coord_flip(clip = "off", expand = FALSE)+
  guides(fill = FALSE)+
  labs(title =" COVID-19 Deaths By Countries", subtitle = "WHO national authorities by 28 April 2020", y = "Total deaths by country", x="Country")
